## Overview

The "Calculate" script is a simple Python program that takes two integer numbers as input and returns their product if it is equal to or less than 1000. If the product exceeds 1000, it returns the sum of the two numbers instead.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter. It will prompt you to enter two numbers.

2. Enter the first integer when prompted: `Enter a number:`

3. Enter the second integer when prompted: `Enter a number:`

4. The script will calculate the product of the two numbers and check if it's less than or equal to 1000.

5. If the product is less than or equal to 1000, it will display the product and the message "result_1."

6. If the product is greater than 1000, it will display the sum of the two numbers and the message "result_2."

7. The script will return the calculated result.
